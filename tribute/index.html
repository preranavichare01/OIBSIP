    <p>
        Dr. B R Ambedkar was born on April 14, 1891, in Mhow, India. He was a key figure in Indian history who faced immense social discrimination as a Dalit (formerly known as untouchable) in the caste-based society. He overcame hardship to achieve academic success and degrees from the London School of Economics, Columbia University, and the University of Bombay.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ambedkar put up a valiant fight against inequality and prejudice based on caste. As chairman of the Indian Constitution drafting committee, he was instrumental in ensuring that all citizens would have social justice, equality, and fundamental rights. His input resulted in the addition of clauses prohibiting untouchability and caste discrimination.
            </p>
<p>
    His advocacy for socioeconomic empowerment and education for marginalised groups went beyond politics. Ambedkar left behind a considerable legacy as a social reformer, economist, and jurist that continues to influence social justice and equality movements across the globe. Though he went away on December 6, 1956, his concepts still influence social reforms and policy-making.
